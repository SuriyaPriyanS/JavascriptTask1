 what is the object


       1.  JavaScript is designed on a simple object-based paradigm. 
        An object is a collection of properties, 
        and a property is an association between a name (or key) and a value.
         A property's value can be a function, in which case the property is known as a method.


         2 . In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example.
          A cup is an object, with properties. A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. 
          The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.


          3. example ;
 
                     
               const obj = {
  property1: value1, // property name may be an identifier
  2: value2, // or a number
  "property n": value3, // or a string
};
